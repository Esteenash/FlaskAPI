     ## Implified Playbook:
1. Develop a Flask API with required endpoints.
2. Write a Dockerfile to package the Flask application as a Docker image.
3. Use docker build to build the Docker image.
4. Test the Docker image using docker run.
5. Push the Docker image to Amazon ECR.
6. Define the infrastructure using Terraform: a. Define a VPC. b. DEfine an ECS cluster. c. Define a task definition for the Flask API container. d. Define a service that will run the Flask API container. e. Define an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and listener rules to route traffic to the service.
7. Deploy the Flask API using a Bash script: a. Authenticate with Amazon ECR. b. Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile. c. Tag the Docker image with a unique version number. d. Push the Docker image to Amazon ECR. e. Update the ECS service to use the new version of the Docker image. f. Run a health check on the API endpoint to ensure the new version is running.
8. Monitor the Flask API using CloudWatch logs and metrics to ensure it is running correctly.
